## Epigraphs

> *Opposing imperialism, taking control and positively bringing about change pretty much always leads to an assassination attempt and hardship. When you see a good leader rise, you can't help but think about when their time will come to an end.* -[`@samiarhymes`](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJL-9kwIGZD/)

> *When will imperialism learn? Yes, they can kill our bodies but they can never kill the spirit of a people fighting for their liberation, they can never kill the spirit of a people fighting for their country and fighting to push their country forward.* - Maurice Bishop
