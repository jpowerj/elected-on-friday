<meta name="citation_abstract" content="In the historiography of political thought, radical thinkers are often characterized as those who &amp;amp;quot;push the boundaries&quot; of the range of acceptable ideas and opinions in a given society at a given time. While formal modeling of strategic &quot;spatial voting&quot; in political science has led to influential results like the Median Voter Theorem, less work has been devoted to assessing strategic behavior among political thinkers at the &quot;margins&quot; of political thought, whose aim is not to *represent* public opinion (and thus win votes) but to *influence it*. In this work, therefore, we posit a &quot;Median Survivor Theorem&quot;, a point on a given ideological spectrum beyond which influential political thinkers are vastly more likely to be assassinated, and then estimate this point via a text-analysis of the topical trajectory of prominent radical thinkers&amp;#039; speeches before and after assassination *attempts* and, especially, before successful assassinations. After demonstrating the efficacy of this approach in terms of ability to predict assassinations from textual content, we zoom in on individual cases, measuring the ideological dissimilarities between thinkers' public and private statements and assessing the degree to which their public &quot;position-taking&quot; exhibited strategic compromises with broader social-discursive boundaries.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=This Nonviolent Stuff’ll Get You Killed: How Guns Made the Civil Rights Movement Possible;,citation_abstract=Visiting Martin Luther King Jr. at the peak of the Montgomery, Alabama bus boycott, journalist William Worthy almost sat on a loaded pistol. “Just for self defense,” King assured him. It was not the only weapon King kept for such a purpose; one of his advisors remembered the reverend’s Montgomery, Alabama home as “an arsenal.”Like King, many ostensibly “nonviolent” civil rights activists embraced their constitutional right to selfprotection—yet this crucial dimension of the Afro-American freedom struggle has been long ignored by history. In This Nonviolent Stuff’ll Get You Killed, civil rights scholar Charles E. Cobb Jr. describes the vital role that armed self-defense played in the survival and liberation of black communities in America during the Southern Freedom Movement of the 1960s. In the Deep South, blacks often safeguarded themselves and their loved ones from white supremacist violence by bearing—and, when necessary, using—firearms. In much the same way, Cobb shows, nonviolent civil rights workers received critical support from black gun owners in the regions where they worked. Whether patrolling their neighborhoods, garrisoning their homes, or firing back at attackers, these courageous men and women and the weapons they carried were crucial to the movement’s success.Giving voice to the World War II veterans, rural activists, volunteer security guards, and self-defense groups who took up arms to defend their lives and liberties, This Nonviolent Stuff’ll Get You Killed lays bare the paradoxical relationship between the nonviolent civil rights struggle and the Second Amendment. Drawing on his firsthand experiences in the civil rights movement and interviews with fellow participants, Cobb provides a controversial examination of the crucial place of firearms in the fight for American freedom.;,citation_author=Charles E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Black and Red: W. E. B. Du Bois and the Afro-American Response to the Cold War, 1944-1963;,citation_abstract=Many historians have seen a radical shift in W.E.B. Du Bois&amp;amp;amp;#39; political activities in his later years. Following World War II, the evolution of his political perspective led to his ouster from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, where he had worked for years, and the Justice Department&amp;#39;s indictment of him for failure to register as a foreign agent. In this extensively researched study, Gerald Horne shows that Du Bois&amp;#39; later activities were the culmination of his lifelong concerns, which Du Bois resolutely followed despite the threats of Cold War McCarthyism. In investigating Du Bois&amp;#39; last 20 years, Horne shows how the confluence of Cold War anticommunism and attempts to discredit the civil rights and anticolonial movements influenced the evaluation of Du Bois&amp;#39; activity. The recently opened papers of W.E.B. Du Bois and previously unexamined papers of the NAACP are among the new sources Horne examined for his study.;,citation_author=Gerald Horne;,citation_publication_date=1986-01;,citation_cover_date=1986-01;,citation_year=1986;,citation_isbn=978-0-88706-087-8;,citation_language=en-US;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Revolting Capital;,citation_abstract=There is a fundamental contradiction in U.S. Imperialism: the capital of this empire for decades has had a majority Black population, which-in turn-has created favorable conditions not only for the erosion of the pestilence that is racism but the flourishing of the antidote that is radicalism. In this sweeping history, Gerald Horne traces this phenomenon over a century, in a book which should be understood and studied by all anti-imperialist and progressive forces.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The White Pacific: U.S. Imperialism and Black Slavery in the South Seas after the Civil War;,citation_abstract=Worldwide supplies of sugar and cotton were impacted dramatically as the U.S. Civil War dragged on. New areas of production entered these lucrative markets, particularly in the South Pacific, and plantation agriculture grew substantially in disparate areas such as Australia, Fiji, and Hawaii. The increase in production required an increase in labor; in the rush to fill the vacuum, freebooters and other unsavory characters began a slave trade in Melanesians and Polynesians that continued into the twentieth century. The White Pacific ranges over the broad expanse of Oceania to reconstruct the history of &amp;amp;amp;quot;blackbirding&amp;quot; (slave trading) in the region. It examines the role of U.S. citizens (many of them ex-slaveholders and ex-confederates) in the trade and its roots in Civil War dislocations. What unfolds is a dramatic tale of unfree labor, conflicts between formal and informal empire, white supremacy, threats to sovereignty in Hawaii, the origins of a White Australian policy, and the rise of Japan as a Pacific power and putative protector. It also pieces together a wonderfully suggestive history of the African American presence in the Pacific. Based on deft archival research in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Hawaii, the United States, and Great Britain, The White Pacific uncovers a heretofore hidden story of race, labor, war, and intrigue that contributes significantly to the emerging intersectional histories of race and ethnicity.;,citation_author=Gerald Horne;,citation_publication_date=2007-05;,citation_cover_date=2007-05;,citation_year=2007;,citation_isbn=978-0-8248-6517-7;,citation_language=en-US;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Nemesis: The Last Days of the American Republic;,citation_abstract=In the stunning conclusion to his bestselling Blowback trilogy, Chalmers Johnson exposes the overreach of the American empire and its dire consequences for the republicIn his prophetic book Blowback, Chalmers Johnson linked the CIA’s clandestine activities abroad to disaster at home. In The Sorrows of Empire, he explored how the growth of American militarism and global garrisoning have jeopardized our stability. Now in Nemesis, Johnson reveals the ways in which imperial overstretch is undermining the republic itself, both economically and politically.Delving into new areas—from plans to militarize outer space to Constitution-breaking presidential activities at home and the devastating corruption of a toothless Congress—Nemesis offers a striking description of the trap into which the ambitions of America’s leaders have taken us. Drawing comparisons to empires past, Johnson explores in vivid detail the unintended consequences of our dependence on a permanent war economy.What does it mean when a nation’s main intelligence organization becomes the president’s secret army? Or when the world’s sole &amp;amp;amp;quot;hyperpower,&amp;quot; no longer capable of paying for its leaders’ vaulting ambitions, becomes the greatest hyper-debtor of all time?

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=In Search of Liberty: African American Internationalism in the Nineteenth-Century Atlantic World;,citation_abstract=In Search of Liberty explores how African Americans, since the founding of the United States, have understood their struggles for freedom as part of the larger Atlantic world. The essays in this volume capture the pursuits of equality and justice by African Americans across the Atlantic World through the end of the nineteenth century, as their fights for emancipation and enfranchisement in the United States continued. This book illuminates stories of individual Black people striving to escape slavery in places like Nova Scotia, Louisiana, and Mexico and connects their eff orts to emigration movements from the United States to Africa and the Caribbean, as well as to Black abolitionist campaigns in Europe. By placing these diverse stories in conversation, editors Ronald Angelo Johnson and Ousmane K. Power-Greene have curated a larger story that is only beginning to be told. By focusing on Black internationalism in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, In Search of Liberty reveals that Black freedom struggles in the United States were rooted in transnational networks much earlier than the better-known movements of the twentieth century.;,citation_author=Ronald Angelo Johnson;,citation_author=Ousmane K.

The Congo was at last being set free from Belgium—one of seventeen countries to gain independence in 1960 from ruling European powers. At the helm as prime minister was charismatic nationalist Patrice Lumumba. Just days after the handover, however, the Congo’s new army mutinied, Belgian forces intervened, and Lumumba turned to the United Nations for help in saving his newborn nation from what the press was already calling “the Congo crisis.” Dag Hammarskjöld, the tidy Swede serving as UN secretary-general, quickly arranged the organization’s biggest peacekeeping mission in history. But chaos was still spreading. Frustrated with the fecklessness of the UN and spurned by the United States, Lumumba then approached the Soviets for help—an appeal that set off alarm bells at the CIA. To forestall the spread of Communism in Africa, the CIA sent word to its station chief in the Congo, Larry Devlin: Lumumba had to go.Within a year, everything would unravel. The CIA plot to murder Lumumba would fizzle out, but he would be deposed in a CIA-backed coup, transferred to enemy territory in a CIA-approved operation, and shot dead by Congolese assassins. Hammarskjöld, too, would die, in a mysterious plane crash en route to negotiate a cease-fire with the Congo’s rebellious southeast. And a young, ambitious military officer named Joseph Mobutu, who had once sworn fealty to Lumumba, would seize power with U.S. help and misrule the country for more than three decades. For the Congolese people, the events of 1960–61 represented the opening chapter of a long horror story. For the U.S. government, however, they provided a playbook for future interventions.;,citation_author=Stuart A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=You Can’t Kill a Man Because of the Books He Reads: Angelo Herndon’s Fight for Free Speech;,citation_abstract=The story of a young, Black Communist Party organizer wrongly convicted of attempting to incite insurrection and the landmark case that made him a civil rights hero. Decades before the impeachment of an American president for a similar offense, Angelo Herndon was charged under Georgia law with “attempting to incite insurrection”—a crime punishable by death. In 1932, the eighteen-year-old Black Communist Party organizer was arrested and had his room illegally searched and his radical literature seized. Charged under an old slave insurrection statute, Herndon was convicted by an all-white jury and sentenced to eighteen to twenty years on a chain gang. You Can’t Kill a Man Because of the Books He Reads chronicles Herndon’s five-year quest for freedom during a time when Blacks, white liberals, and the radical left joined forces to define the nation’s commitment to civil rights and civil liberties. Herndon’s champions included the young, Black Harvard Law School–educated attorney Benjamin J. Davis Jr.; the future historian C. Vann Woodward, who joined the interracial Herndon defense committee; the white-shoe New York lawyer Whitney North Seymour, who argued Herndon’s appeals; and literary friends Ralph Ellison, Langston Hughes, and Richard Wright. With their support, Herndon won his freedom and reinvented himself as a Harlem literary star until a dramatic fall from grace. A legal odyssey of Herndon’s narrow escape from certain death because of his unpopular political beliefs, You Can’t Kill a Man Because of the Books He Reads explores Herndon’s journey from Alabama coal miner to Communist Party organizer to Harlem hero and beyond. Brad Snyder tells the stories of the diverse coalition of people who rallied to his cause and who twice appealed his case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The charismatic Kwame Nkrumah, who had just won Ghana’s independence, led a determined appeal for Pan-Africanism. &nbsp;Young, idealistic leaders across the continent, as well as African Americans seeking civil rights at home, heeded his call. Yet, a moment that signified a new era of African freedom simultaneously marked a new era of foreign intervention and control. In White Malice, Susan Williams unearths the CIA’s covert operations from Ghana to the Congo to the UN, which frustrated the attempts of Africa’s new generation of nationalist leaders to establish democratic governance. These revelations dramatically upend the conventional wisdom that African nations failed to establish effective, democratic states on their own accord. As the old European powers moved out, the US moved in.&nbsp;&nbsp; Drawing on original research and recently declassified documents, Williams introduces readers to idealistic African leaders and to the secret agents, ambassadors, and even presidents who deliberately worked against them, forever altering the future of a continent.;,citation_author=Susan Williams;,citation_publication_date=2021-08;,citation_cover_date=2021-08;,citation_year=2021;,citation_isbn=978-1-5417-6828-4;,citation_language=en-US;">

        <p>In the historiography of political thought, radical thinkers are often characterized as those who “push the boundaries” of the range of acceptable ideas and opinions in a given society at a given time. While formal modeling of strategic “spatial voting” in political science has led to influential results like the Median Voter Theorem, less work has been devoted to assessing strategic behavior among political thinkers at the “margins” of political thought, whose aim is not to <em>represent</em> public opinion (and thus win votes) but to <em>influence it</em>. In this work, therefore, we posit a “Median Survivor Theorem”, a point on a given ideological spectrum beyond which influential political thinkers are vastly more likely to be assassinated, and then estimate this point via a text-analysis of the topical trajectory of prominent radical thinkers’ speeches before and after assassination <em>attempts</em> and, especially, before successful assassinations. After demonstrating the efficacy of this approach in terms of ability to predict assassinations from textual content, we zoom in on individual cases, measuring the ideological dissimilarities between thinkers’ public and private statements and assessing the degree to which their public “position-taking” exhibited strategic compromises with broader social-discursive boundaries.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Spatial metaphors abound in the historiography of political thought. Political scientists, for example, often employ the notion of an “Overton Window” to denote the range of acceptable ideas and opinions within a given society at a given time, such that “radical” thinkers can be characterized in turn as those who push the boundaries of this range.</p>
<p>These metaphors then underlie a slew of formal and empirical research endeavors in the social sciences, such as “ideal point estimation” <span class="citation" data-cites="poole_spatial_1985">(<a href="#ref-poole_spatial_1985" role="doc-biblioref">Poole and Rosenthal 1985</a>)</span>, whereby voters’ positions along the Overton Window are represented as points on the real numberline (<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>), while electoral candidates strategically choose platform positions with respect to the range of their constituents’ ideological points. Several influential results emerge from this framework, such as the Median Voter Theorem, which states that two “rational” candidates competing for votes from the same constituency will adopt nearly-identical platforms (differing by an infinitesimally-small magnitude <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span>), at exactly the median of their constituents’ ideological points in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>, since any move away from this point will reduce the proportion of captured candidates below 50%.</p>
<p>In this work, we employ this framework to analyze the <em>strategy</em> of radical thinkers, and find that indeed there is a “Median Radicalism” point whereby those thinkers whose speech moves beyond this point drastically increase their likelihood of being assassinated. After presenting our methodology and findings, we then use more “in-depth”, small-<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> evidence to assess the degree to which radical thinkers make these strategic choices in a <em>conscious</em> manner: that is, the extent to which broader cultural <em>“enforcement”</em> of the Overton Window (e.g., in media or activist discourse), in conjunction with the fear of assassination, leads such thinkers to curb their radicalism in public statements relative to their private writings (e.g., in personal journals or correspondence with fellow radical thinkers).</p>

<p>As an instance of developing a “Minimum Viable Product” (MVP), we begin our study in an exploratory mode. We operationalize popular notions that Martin Luther King’s foray into particular strands of discourse – concretely, his increasingly-urgent calls to his constituency to focus on and oppose the United States’ genocides in Vietnam and Indochina more broadly – “led to” his assassination<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. At this stage, however, we also note that “stopping” with just the single case of Martin Luther King would subject our study to the bias of <em>selection on the dependent variable</em>. Thus, while we choose cases more methodically in <strong>?@sec-methods</strong> using a statistical matching approach, here we choose Black Panther Party chairman Huey Newton as our “control” case <span class="citation" data-cites="newton_revolutionary_1973">(<a href="#ref-newton_revolutionary_1973" role="doc-biblioref">Newton 1973</a>)</span>, as a political thinker whose radical thought also brought him to the forefront of the black liberation movement only a few years after King’s murder, but who was not assassinated until decades later<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
